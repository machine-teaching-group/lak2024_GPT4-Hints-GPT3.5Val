(1) The bug in the original program is that it starts checking for common divisors from the minimum of A and B and goes down to 2. This approach will fail when the GCD is 1, as it is not checking for 1. The fix is to use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD, which is what the corrected program does. It keeps dividing the larger number by the smaller number and replaces the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is 0. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder.

(2) Hint: The original program fails to consider a scenario where the greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.
