The bug in the program is in the slicing of the strings when one string is longer than the other. In the original program, when S1 is longer than S2, the remaining characters of S1 are not correctly added to the result. The same issue occurs when S2 is longer than S1. The fix is to slice the longer string from the length of the shorter string to the end, instead of slicing from the end.
