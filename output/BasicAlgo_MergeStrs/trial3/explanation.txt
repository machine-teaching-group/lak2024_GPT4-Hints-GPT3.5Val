The bug in the program is in the slicing of the strings when one string is longer than the other. In the original program, when S1 is longer than S2, the remaining part of S1 that is appended to the result is sliced from the end of S1, not from the point where S2 ends. Similarly, when S2 is longer than S1, the remaining part of S2 is sliced from the end of S2, not from the point where S1 ends. The fix is to slice the remaining part of the longer string from the point where the shorter string ends.
